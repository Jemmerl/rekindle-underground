Current
-> Placer ore deposits:
- Add small/tiny and rich ore varieties (with those specific names!) [ ]
    * Will be used for placer deposits, so I gotta do it sooner than later...
- Add sand, gravel, and red sand "stone ores" [ ]
- Add biome checks to deposits [X]

Short Term
- Implement other ore deposit types (vein, placer, porphyry, SOIL/BOG/CLAY, etc) [ ]
- Actually get textures done [ ]
- Improve stone generation [ ]
- Make biomes able to be category or specific. two json lists in one obj? [ ]

Long Term
- Seam-type ores (coal) [ ]
- Evaporate-type ores [ ]
- Salt domes? [ ]
- Balance and add ore drop variability/configurability [ ]
- RockType might be redundant, rework to just use StoneType for registration

Like, Really Long Term
- API to add in a custom ore that works with the mod's stone [ ]
