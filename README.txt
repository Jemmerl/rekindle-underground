Jem's Geology is a mod originally developed by Jemmerl (and with direct and in-direct help from countless others)
for use in the modpack: Rekindle. Originally called "Rekindle Underground", it has been renamed to reflect its now
more general focus.

IT IS IN DEVELOPMENT, AND MANY FEATURES ARE INCOMPLETE OR NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!
MUCH IS POORLY CODED AND WOULD LIKELY BREAK OUTSIDE A DEV ENVIROMENT IF NOT USED EXACTLY AS INTENDED.

Jem's Geo was created out of the want for a realistic yet still highly configurable geological generation mod.
It is currently mainly for use within the in-dev Rekindle modpack, but is being worked on to eventually be suitable
for general use. It is NOT a standalone mod. Consider it more as a library of realistic stones, ores, and generation
that modpack makers can utilize to bring their worlds to... not-life? Stones are not alive, as far as I can recall!

Included are 50+ generatable stones, plus their respective regolith, cobble, and decorative variants.
Additonally, 50+ ores are available to mine. These ores can be generated as several kinds of deposits.
Large layers or blobs, placer deposits in rivers, large porphyry masses, hydrothermal veins, or even Minecraft-style
scattering if desired! Properties such as ore richness, density, spawn heights, valid geology, and
even mixes of different ores in the same deposit are configurable!

Moreover, there is no longer a need for silk-touch to acquire raw stone. Get a chisel and start an open pit quarry!
By requiring multiple faces open to quarry raw stone, players are highly encouraged to build realistic quarries to
most efficiently harvest stone.

Features include highly variable and random stone strata generation. No more just-flat stone layers; JemGeo's strata
can be deformed, tilted, and curvy! These features operate using user-defined stone presets and generate within
configurable ranges. This means if one does not want a realistic setting, more of one rock over another, etc., then
any such desires are possible! Any parameter such as the rock-set of regions that generate to how each region's strata
behaves is 100% configurable. As little as possible is hard coded!

Another configurable feature is the hardness of the various stones themselves! By default, they are harder to mine
than vanilla obsidian. As someone who has swung a steel pickaxe at a rock wall, I can assure you, it is not as easy
as Minecraft makes it out to be. This is of course due to the mod's primary usage being the Rekindle pack, where
underground activities are meant to be "difficult-difficult-lemon-difficult"! Even worse, starting at Y-Level 50,
the stones get harder and harder to mine. Both of these features are completely configurable.

Formations such as igneous bodies or hydrothermal deposits are also included! For example: explosive diatreme-maar
formations that include kimberlite pipes can be found! No more getting your diamonds from Y-Level 16, you need to get
prospecting! One can also expect to find dikes and sills, surface boulders, hydrothermally deposited veins,
river and beach placers, large igneous plutons, flood basalt "traps", surface regoliths, and more -- need I say it?
All entirely user configurable!

Over time, greater control is planned for these features. With more power comes more complexity, but built-in
documentation is planned for your reading pleasure!
