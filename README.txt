Rekindle Underground is a mod developed by Jemmerl (and with direct and in-direct help from countless others) for use
in the modpack of the same name: Rekindle.

RKU was created out of the want for a realistic yet still highly configurable geological generation mod.
It is currently only intended for use within the Rekindle modpack, but may one day be improved to the point
of general use. It is NOT a standalone mod. Consider it more as a library of realistic stones, ores, and generation
that modpack makers can utilize to bring their worlds to... not-life? Stones are not alive, as far as I can recall!

It is designed to mimic real-world geology, obviously within the limits of Minecraft.
Features include highly variable and random stone strata generation. No more just-flat stone layers; RKU's strata are
deformed, tilted, and curvy! Even better, the ore follows these curves like one would expect in real life! These
features operate using user-defined stone presets and generate within configurable ranges.

Another configurable feature is the hardness of the various stones themselves! By default, they are harder to mine
than vanilla obsidian. As someone who has swung a steel pickaxe at a rock wall, I can assure you, it is not as easy
as Minecraft makes it out to be. This is of course due to the mod's primary usage being the Rekindle pack, where
underground activities are meant to be "difficult-difficult-lemon-difficult"!

Even worse, starting at Y-Level 50, the stones get harder and harder to mine. This too is completely configurable.

Formations such as igneous bodies or hydrothermal deposits are also included! For example: explosive diatreme-maar
formations that include kimberlite pipes can be found! No more getting your diamonds from Y-Level 16, you need to get
prospecting! One can also expect to find dikes and sills, hydrothermally deposited veins, river and beach placers,
large igneous plutons, basalt-gabbro "traps", and more!

Over time, greater control is planned for these features. With more power comes more complexity, but built-in
documentation is planned for your reading pleasure!
