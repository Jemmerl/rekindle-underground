Current
-> Placer ore deposits:
- Add small/tiny and rich ore varieties (with those specific names!)
    * Will be used for placer deposits, so I gotta do it sooner than later...
- Add sand, gravel, and red sand "stone ores"

Short Term
- Implement other ore deposit types (vein, placer, porphyry, SOIL/BOG/CLAY, etc)
- Actually get textures done
- Improve stone generation

Long Term
- Layer-type ores (coal)
- Evaporate-type ores
- Salt domes?
- Balance and add ore drop variability/configurability

Like, Really Long Term
- API to add in a custom ore that works with the mod's stone
